# Image_Operations
Java Swing Based Project for Encrypting and Decrypting an Image.


Way to Operate:

Encryption:

Write an Integer in the Text Box(which will be treated as a key).
Click on the Button and select any image to encrypt.
A message will be displayed once it is done.

N.B : Try Opening the image, it won't.

Decryption:

Run the program again and pass the same key and upload the encrypted image.
A message will be displayed once decryption is complete.
Close the program and re-open the image, it will be there.

N.B : Dont forget the key during encryption, as it the password to decrypt it.
